Data and analysis files from Vuorinen, Keller, & Tatler.

## Folder set up

There are five main folders:
1. Prep: Scripts for data cleaning and wrangling, computation of reading behaviour measures
2. Analysis: Scripts for analysis (modelling of reading behaviour)
3. Data: Data collected for this study (n = 60) that is used in Prep and Analysis. Multiple datafiles provided from raw to wrangled.
4. Functions: Custom functions used in the Prep or Analysis. Functions not created by the authors, see comments for credit.
5. Info: Document with information on the reading behaviour tracking system.

File naming system: Folder_IntentionForUse.filetype, e.g., Analysis_ReadingSpeedModel.Rmd = R markdown file for analysis of reading speed by modelling.
Data files are named in lowercase and underscores (snake case), e.g. raw_tracking_data, continuous variables and covariates are named with Pascal Case, e.g. UserId, whereas binary test variables are named in Camel Case, e.g. isEngagedReading.
FIX: it could be better to stick to one naming convention
