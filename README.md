## Folder set up

There are seven main folders:
1. Prep: Scripts for data cleaning and wrangling, computation of reading behaviour measures
2. Analysis: Scripts for analysis (modelling of reading behaviour)
3. Data: Data collected for this study (n = 60) that is used in Prep and Analysis. Multiple datafiles provided from raw to wrangled.
4. Functions: Custom functions used in the Prep or Analysis. Functions not created by the authors, see comments for credit.
5. Info: Document with information on the reading behaviour tracking system.
6. Figures: Scripts for all important figures and the figures as image files.
7. Extra: Additional documents such as r-packages bibTeX file.

File naming system: Folder_IntentedUsage.filetype, e.g., Analysis_ReadingSpeedModel.Rmd: R markdown file for analysis of reading speed by modelling.
Data files are named in lowercase and underscores (snake case), e.g. raw_tracking_data, variables are named with Pascal Case, e.g. UserId
