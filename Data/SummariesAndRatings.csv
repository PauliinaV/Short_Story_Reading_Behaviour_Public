The messenger can not speak, but the letter explains that Derby killed Asenath, smashing her head and burying her in the cellar. However, Asenath's (who may be her father, Ephraim) soul is detached from her body and can only be destroyed by cremation. Asenath was able to possess Derby in the sanitorium, so the hunched figure at the door was in fact Derby inhabiting Asenaths rotten corpse. The letter hints that Ephraim originally possessed his daughter and has now done the same to Derby, after wanting a man's body. The note implores Upton to go to the sanitorium to kill Derby, who is now possessed by Ephraim.;5;3

1;Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson take the train to solve the murder case of Charles McCarthy. James McCarthy, the son of the victim, is sought to be the prime suspect of the murder. According to a witness, James had an argument with his dad and was seen carrying a gun prior to the murder. However, James claims to be innocent and says he heard his dad saying 'Coeee' and something along the line of a 'rat' as his last words. He also mentions that he had seen a grey coat lying in the murder scene but that it had quickly disappeared as he went to get help. Alice, James' lover, also believes that the latter is innocent. Through investigation, Holmes is able to deduce that the killer is Alice's dad, John Turner, as he is able to connect the dots between 'rat' and 'Ballarat', which is a place in Australia and 'cooee' which is an Australian cry. John Turner confesses to his crimes and mentions that he had killed Charles because he did not want his daughter, Alice, to be married to James. John signs a statement confessing his crimes and Holmes promises him that he would not unveil his secrets unless it is absolutely needed to save James. In the end, James is acquitted and John dies 7 months later.;6;3

1;Sherlock Holmes and Watson attempt to solve the murder of McCarthy. McCarthy's son is the primary suspect as he was seen quarrelling with his father just before his murder, but the son denies it and Holmes sees evidence to suggest that it was someone else. McCarthy and his friend Turner had come into money through unsavoury means in Australia, and they had both returned to England and remained in touch. McCarthy was eager for his son James to marry Turner's daughter Alice, however it becomes clear that no one but McCarthy wanted this. After visiting the scene of the crime, Holmes concludes that the murderer was a man with a limp who smoked, and research into the history of the two men reveals that McCarthy's last word referred to the place where he and Turner lived in Australia. This leads Holmes to confront Turner, as he now fits the profile of the murderer. Turner confesses immediately, but explains that he murdered McCarthy because he had been blackmailing him and exploiting his wealth for years and he could not face it if his daughter were forced to marry the son of the man who had done this to him. Holmes sympathises with Turner, and tells him that he will not reveal his account in the trial unless James is wrongly sentenced. In the end, Holmes manages to provide evidence to exonerate James without revealing that Turner was the murderer.;7;3

1;Watson goes with Holmes to investigate a murder that Holmes has decided sounds too simple to have been solved correctly by Lestrade. Holmes investigates the area where the murder takes place and makes a number of deductions about the man who committed the murder by following the tracks he left. He summons the murderer and they get a confession out of him, discovering that the whole thing was to do with a would-be marriage as they had suspected. This confession is never used as the accused does not have enough evidence against him to be charged and the case is dropped, with the murderer dying of poor health shortly afterwards.;2;2

Harry asks for Eudora's response to marrying him and she first of all tells him that she has a secret. She tells him that the cot she has been pushing around didn't have a baby in it but rather, it was full of linens. She explains that she was low on money and since the Lancaster's were looking for a maid to clean their laundry, Eudora agreed to undertake this job. She didn't want anyone in the neighbourhood finding out, however, so she pretended she had a baby so that she could hide the linen in the cot because she was too proud to confess her financial situation. Harry Lawson asked how she came to have a real baby then and she said she adopted one yesterday after having met him because she was embarrassed about lying to him. He confesses that he has always loved her and she says it is reciprocated. She explains that she avoided him when they were younger because she felt he was going to ask her to marry him but she wasn't able to give him an answer. At the end, the neighbours recall Henry Lawson's presence for over an hour in Eudora's house.;3;3

1;Watson receives a telegram from Sherlock Holmes, in which he is invited to join him as he has been called to solve a case at Boscombe Valley. While they are travelling by train towards their destination, they read the newspapers to learn more about what happened. A man, of surname McCarthy, has been found dead and his son is considered to be the murderer, because some had witnessed him arguing with the father near the scene of the murder. Sherlock Holmes has been employed by a young woman, daughter of the owner of the estate in which the murder was committed (a man named Turner), because she thinks he is innocent. When they arrive, Holmes and Watson join Scotland Yard's investigator Lestrade and speak with the young woman. They then visit the scene of the murder. In the end, the young man is proved to be innocent. The real culprit is Turner, the old man owner of the estate.

Turner couldn't take it no more when he saw McCarthy trying to convince his son to marry his daughter, and so, when the young McCarthy went away, he killed him. This confession is given to Holmes and Watson by Turner himself but it's never revealed to the public. The young McCarthy is declared innocent in Assizes and the old Turner dies 7 months after the events of the murder.;7;3
